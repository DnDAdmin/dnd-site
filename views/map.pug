        p This is the map I made for the novel I want to write. The information included here is pretty limited. I have a more full version on my website.
        p The map draws data from an online database to determine location names,  coordinates, type, information, and any potential photos. All interactivity is vanilla JavaScript and CSS.
        strong *Note: I built this map for desktop computers using mouse and keyboard. It is currently not compatible with mobile, touch screen devices.
